# Python-Project
Currency Converter Project with GUI using Python
Python can be used to develop this simple GUI application. This project is about
building a currency converter that will allow you to convert currencies from one
unit to another, such as converting Indian rupee into pounds or euros.The
design of this application will be straightforward, focusing on the primary
function, which is converting currency units. With Tkinter, you can access the Tk
GUI toolkit, which comes with Python.This currency converter project in python
requires a basic understanding of python programming and the pygame library.

OBJECTIVE - Currency converters aim to maintain real-time 
information on current market or bank exchange rates,
so that the calculated result changes whenever the
value of either of the component currencies does. They
do so by connecting to a database of current currency
exchange rates.

Different countries use different currencies, and there
is daily variation in these currencies relative to one
another. Those who transfer money from one country
to another (one currency to another) must be updated
with the latest currency exchange rates in the market.
Currency converter mini project is built keeping this
thing in mind. It is simply a calculator-like app
developed using Ajax, Java servlets web features. In
this application, there is a regular update about the
currency of every country by which it displays present
currency market value and conversion rate.
Such applications can be used by any user, but it is
mainly useful for business, shares, and finance related
areas where money transfer and currency exchange
takes place on a daily basis.

In this currency converter app, users are provided with
an option to select the type of conversion, i.e. from
“this” currency to “that” currency. This simple feature
allows users to enter the amount to be converted (say
currency in Dollars), and display the converted
amount (say currency in Euro).
It is a simple GUI where we have to enter an amount
which we want to be converted , then enter the base
currency rate and the currency to which we want to
convert to.
It uses :
● Real-time exchange rates (OpenAPI)
● Libraries ( Tkinter , Requests)
● UI for Currency_Converter(Tkinter)
